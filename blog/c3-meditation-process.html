            <h3>How did the 'process over product' concept affect the way you tackled the site redesign and rebuild?</h3>
            <p>
                At the beginning I didn't get the point of 'process over product',Then i read again of the material for the concept.I kept 'Process over product' in mind while i was redesigning and building the blog site. So i can try to impelement as many features as i can, just play and explore, rather than persue perfect products at this stage. Eventually there will be a good product.

              <p>
                Before I read chapter 2, I thought meditation is just we sit quietly and think about things, figure out what's happenning and why it happens. Never know there are so many stuff to talk about meditation.

            <h3>Did any of the suggested mediation techniques stand out to you?</h3>
            <p>
              I picked up some techniques that sounds good for me. Find the comfortable posture,Keep awake, be alert and relaxed. Also let things go, not be distracted too much, maintain the concentration when my mind wanders away.

            <p>
              Sometime when i get bored,I think about what is the meanning of living in this world.Why do we come here, what do we want? My friend told me, life is how we make up of it. Yes,I think i should just concentrate on what i am doing, and enjoy life, being who i am, and be a happy person.
