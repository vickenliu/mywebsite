            <h3>What is your experience of compassionate (or not) leadership?</h3>
            <p>
              I have a very good experience with compassionate leadership when i was working for my last employer in NZ. I had a new production manager he was much more compassionate comparing with the previouse one for me. There was a peoriod I was struggling to carry on with that day-to-day basic operating jobs.i felt confused of my personal future life and career development,I had talk with him about what i was hesitating about,He showed me support to chase what i belive to be happy , even tried to find new roles for me to fit in.I do feel appreciate for what he did.After his taking over as PM, we felt we are cared about,and our voice can be heard.The relationship among us gets closer and relaxing.We working a boring job without grunppy mood as often as before.I like compassionate leaders.

            <h3>Do the multiplying goodness meditation. How did you find it?</h3>
            <p>
              I couldnt manage myself to do that, It sounds too ideally abstract for me. I understand the whole point is keep calm, and be cool. nice to others.and take everything easy.

            <h3> How does the SCARF model apply to your phase-0 experience so far? How will it apply to bootcamp?</h3>
            <p>
              I don't even quite clear what is SCARF model? It must be about what we have learnt through this course.Well, honestly, I didnt feel quite helpful about this 'search inside me'. things sound making perfect sences, the problem is how to put them in use in daily-basis life. If every human being can do that, there will be no conflict , no wars, no violence. So it s not just through some vedios's effect to see the outcome. I know it takes time.<br>
              While i strongly agree we need to do meditation every now and then, think of others, be empathy, figure out of who we are and what kind of person we want to be. Happy is simple, just experience the life, keep building our inner personality. be a good person.<br>
              This experiece absolutely bring some highlight words for me to carry on with bootcamp, Listening to others mindfullnessly, Understand others, and be myself to show other people the positive from me.

            <h3>Have a difficult conversation. How did it go? (It's a valuable skill, but can take practice to develop!)</h3>
            <p>
              Absolutely there are memories about difficult conversations in my head. some of them are because of language barrier, or lack of confidence. even lost interest about the topic or the person. The feeling is aweful, and it didnt go anywhere of the talk.<br>
              I noticed the frustration i had,so i try my best to calm down say things slowly,and gentally. smile and keep communication smooth. it helps, and kills the confusion.
              Sure i have to keep learning from these experiences, take more practice to develop this kind of skills.
