            <h3>How does life look through the 'pleasure, passion and purpose' lens?</h3>
            <p>
              I am not sure if i understand it correctly. I will just write what is in my head about life through the 3 different aspects.<br/>
              There is not much pleasure happenning in my life at the moment,it was a mess with some life changing things drag me down,weeks after weeks,i am getting through and moving on for a bright tomorrow,I still got hope which helps me motivate me to be a happier person.<br/>
              I have the passion to chase the purpose i have to be a happy person, and useful human being.There was a quite long period of my life i was confused and lost what i want and how to live the rest of my life. Eventually i figured it out, life is how you treat it, just enjoy and being happy. Do things you like and social with people you enjoy being around with.I am recharging myself to be the passionate and energized man chasing the true meaning of why we live in this world.

            <h3>What are your core values? && What do you stand for?</h3>
            <p>
              When i get lost and depressed, I thought i am an useless person,I am just nobody. when the time flies, i got the point everyone of us is individual, I live for myself, to enjoy a human's happiness, to love and be loved. We work and do our job to make it that we call 'daily life'.<br/>
              Obviously we all stand for ourselves, so do i, i stand for myself, being who i am. stand for the faith of if you have dream you should never give up.

            <h3>How did you find the resilience ideas and meditation exercise?</h3>
            <p>
              It helps me keeping calmed and being optimistic to face failure. Motivate me not to give up.

            <h3>Any other musings?</h3>
            <p>
              I am not too sure how many people would be like me,I agree with the method talked in the videos, and I believe it definetly can make my life change dramaticlly if i follow the correct way. But seems it is very easy to forget to put them in practise in the daily life. I just keep forgetting most of the technics talked in the 'search inside yourself'.
