            <h3> About Empathy</h3>
            <p>
              I checked the dictionary for 'Empathy',Because I confused it with 'Sympathy'.In my word and after watching the video,I believe i have the ability to share another's feeling and emotion.The life experience approves that Empathy do bring me closer to other people. In another word,try to understand the person you are facing, jump out of self-centered,we can win close relationship, trust and sincerity. Treating people with empathy, i belive i can make more friends,bring them close to me, also it can soften the conflic between our human relationship.
              <br>
              In my culture, we have a old saying "think 3 times before you take action". i believe it covers empathy listening, and love kindness meditation, It remind us to think in different ways, for ourselves,also think in other's standing point of views. This could stop us doing thing with emotion, try to save us from being regret.

            <h3>Political Awareness practising</h3>
            <p>
              As a new comer from other country,I have very limited social network so far. some reasons blames my interpersonal, I am not very talkative, or open enough for somehow. I will and have to work more on this to have a rich personal networks.<br>
              Last week i have read some EDA graduates' blogs about their life with EDA and after EDA, it helps me understand more about this orgnization,and her spirit. which really deserves me to build on. This is the reason I am on board to study with bunch of eager-to-learn cohorts.<br>
              From the slack channel and previouse assignments, I am impressed how fast some people can grow,we are from different background, brings so much flavor to this team, it does open my eyes. Work with other cohort is a challenging and exciting part for me, We learn from eachother, and improve together. Growing individually is not what i want, I wish all of us could reach a high enough level when we graduate,i will feel hornored as a team to repersent EDA's success,and earn our reputation in this industry. I believe we can get close to the goal we set when we chose to attend this course.
